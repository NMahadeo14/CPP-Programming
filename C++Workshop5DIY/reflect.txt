Workshop 5 Reflection

In this Workshop we practise the use of operator functions within the Code
for this workshop i did have a significant amount of problems with the 
implementation of the coding for the operators, this workshop was frustrating because 
i had the understanding of what the operators should be doing but i would run into errors
that i wasnt sure how to fix because of how the code should be implementing. after playing 
around with the code for a bit and having cornel explain it to me i started to understand how it 
was supposed to work and was able to complete the in lab portion on the workshop.

when moving on to the at home portion it came down to knowing how to initialize an array so that 
the code would know that it was supposed to be of infinite size and that i would be using dynamic memory
to let the code know how big the array should be, i was able to implement the operator += alot faster and easier
this time around, but figuring out how to properly deal with the dynamic memory for the Shiptype is where i struggled
from this point onward because i was getting alot of exception errors dealing with not sizing the dynamic memory properly
and then the code breaking because of access violation, i was able to figure out access violation but to fix the array 
size for the type, i was misunderstanding the variables and what certain variables were actually doing so i was sizing
the array incorrectly, after doing that i was able to figure out how to fix the code, and understand what is happening. 
because of this misunderstanding i think i may have messed up alot on the midterm when it came to the operators, but 
i think that after going over my code i should be ok moving forward, because my understanding is better then it was before
and im not struggling as much as i was before. i think i definitly need to still spend more time on the operators to fully 
get rid of any misunderstanding i have, but i should be fine if i need to implement any more in the future.
