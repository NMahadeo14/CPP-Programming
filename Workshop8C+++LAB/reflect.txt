Reflection Workshop 8

This Workshop was really easy, especially after completing MS3 before attempting to do this 
i had little to no trouble completing this Workshop and MS3 for that matter, i was really happy
with the lack of trouble i had in completing the 2 assigments and has me reassured that i am 
continuing to improve in my ability to code even tho sometimes i definitly have some problems 
understanding concepts. Learning new concepts are going to be challenging for me without the in 
person lecutures for me, i just cant learn as effictivly in online lecture then i can in person 
but im doing my best to understand so that i can complete the MSs and WS that we still need to 
complete.
