Workshop 9 Reflection

This Workshop was also very easy to me, but im not sure at all if i really
understand what templates are doing, i completed the workshop and did all the
functions with what the instructions said to but im not sure what the template
really did to affect my code,  which i guess isnt really a good thing because
i completed the workshop but still had no clue what the Concept of the Workshop
was doing. im trying to read into it more, and figure out what templates are used
for. Im also getting better at completeing the Milestones while actually understanding
what im doing and what the Milestone is asking of me. Of course i have the odd errors that 
i ask for assistance for, but there have been a could of errors that ive gotten in the past
that i now know how to fix if i get them and has helped improve my coding habits, another thing
that ive noticed since then is that i should start trying to comment in my code, i never made a
habit of this because not alot of other people were reading my code and i knew what my code was
doing, so i never commented it for other people to understand.
