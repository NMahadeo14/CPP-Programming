Workshop 1 Reflection

In Workshop 1 we were the workshops main focus was on compiling modules together when given code, and putting together the header and cpp files for that code.
In this Workshop i didnt run into many problems as the code was already done for me which i found as a surprise, it was more moving around code to where it
should be and then creating the prototypes for the functions that was not provided which was easy. I only ran into 2 problems while doing the workshop which were
problems in the way i used the namespace that was i was being instructed to use which was sdds and how to get my code to read the file FoxInSock.txt and produce
an output. The problem with the namespace, i was doing using namespace sdds at the top of my files instead of namespace sdds{} and enclosing everything in the brackets
so my code was not recognising that i had made function definitions for the prototypes that i was declaring. The issue for why i wasnt able to get an output from the
source file was because i did not include the source file in the local directory of the project, once i included that into the correct directory i was able to get an output
and everything worked correctly as it should have. Other then those problems, this lab was pretty easy, mainly because it was only rearranging code, not writing it myself 
which would have made it significantly harder based on the code that was provided and what i would have had to code. After the first week of classes im feeling a little more 
confident in my abilites to understand and debug code while looking at it, and have a better understanding of the concepts of addresses, values and references.
