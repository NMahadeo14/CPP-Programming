1. Static memory is the memory that the operating system allocates
for the application at load time, static memory includes the memory
allocated for the program instructions and program data, while dynamic
memory is the memory that an application obtains from the operating system
during execution, Dynamic memory is distinct from the static memory. 
While the operating system allocated static memory for an application
at load time, the system reserves dynamic memory, allocates it and deallocates
it at run-time.

2.While doing this workshop the errors i was coming accross was
how to allocate data so that the application would take the values 
i would enter and use that after execution, i would know how to 
initialize the pointers and such, but after that step it was confusing
on how to incorporated it into the code on pattern step on the wrap() function 
for example.

3. void gifting(char*) - this function took a single character pointer as a parameter
void gifting(double&) - this function took a double reference as a parameter
void gifting(int&) - this function took a int reference as a parameter 
void gifting(Gift&) - this funtion took a Gift reference

4. I Struggled with completing this Workshop only because i had trouble understanding
how to properly allocate dynamic memory, and how to use that dynamic memory when i did
finally allocate it, but in completing this workshop i learned how to properly use and 
allocate dynamic memory for my applications after execution and how in doing this properly
can prevent issue in compilation such as memory leak, or insufficent memory for my application
to run.
