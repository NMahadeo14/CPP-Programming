This workshop was by far the easiest for me after fixing the being able to identify the problems with submitting
the in lab portion onto matrix, in this workshop i learned how a constructor and destructor work, and how to properly
implement them into my code along with practising other concepts that we have learned in class, and was able to 
complete the workshop with minimal errors, because of this i was able to look at all parts of this workshop and
fully understand what different parts of the workshop were doing, while working on this workshop i ran into value
errors that i was able to quickly fix because of the debugging tool that i have been able to practise using from the
beginning of the semester, and i think that i am pretty good at using it, this helps me when im stuck on my code, and prevents
me from being stuck on one place for too long, because i am able to identify where it is that my code is going wrong
the only issues that i can see from myself is that when my code gives me exception errors, i do not know how to fix the problem
and i fine that looking up exception errors dont really help aswell because online most solutions for these errors are 
realy vague and hard to understand. if there is a why to figure out how to know what exceptions are giving me errors and how to
fix them in my code, i feel like that would be the next step in me improving my coding and understanding skills.
